                <p>At Mercy Manor Health Care, we understand that emotional well-being is just as important as physical health—especially for our elderly clients. Our Companion Care Services are designed to bring warmth, comfort, and meaningful connection to seniors who may be living alone or in need of social interaction and support.
                  At Mercy Manor, we believe that no one should feel alone in their golden years. Through our Companion Care program, we strive to enhance the quality of life for seniors by providing trusted support, heartfelt presence, and genuine friendship—because caring is not just what we do, it’s who we are.
