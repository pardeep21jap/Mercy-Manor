                <p>Homemaking service is a non-medical support service that helps individuals maintain a clean, safe, and comfortable home environment. It is especially helpful for seniors, people with disabilities, or anyone who may have difficulty managing daily household tasks. Homemaking caregivers assist with activities such as light housekeeping, laundry, meal preparation, grocery shopping, organizing living spaces, and maintaining overall home cleanliness.</p><br></br>
